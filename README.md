# Gradient-Boosting
I trained the dataset using an XGBoost classifier and compare its accuracy with the five algorithms mentioned in the video.
The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved an accuracy of 94.56% on the dataset.

Comparison with the 5 Algorithms from the Video:
Random Forest: ~89.0%
Multinomial Naive Bayes: ~80.0%
Decision Tree: ~92.0%
Logistic Regression: ~87.0%
Support Vector Machine: ~87.0%
Gradient Boosting (New): 94.56%
Gradient Boosting outperforms all the previously used models.
